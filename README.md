# SpeakEasy

## Inspiration
Have you ever felt uneasy about an upcoming interaction, trying to rehearse and prepare yourself for every deviation a conversation can take? Inspired to help people better prepare themselves and feel confident in their abilities, our team members created SpeakEasy.   

## What it does
SpeakEasy prepares users for the difficult, and sometimes awkward conversations we all have to face. From speaking to a job recruiter to interacting with your significant otherâ€™s parents, we leveraged cutting-edge technologies and machine learning tools to offer personalized assistance to our users. 

## How we built it
We built our frontend using Next.js, a javascript framework that allows for customization and exhaustive web design. We connected our frontend to our backend code using Flask, a python library. Furthermore, to store our user data and past conversations with the AI, we used MongoDB which allowed us to customize the chatbot interactions. Finally, for the backend, we used python and the NVIDIA NIM API to build our model and allow it to give the user feedback based on their responses.
